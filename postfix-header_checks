# The following lines are intended to delete messages that report a virus incident.
# As virus incidents today often involve forged email addresses, so that the notification
# is sent to somebody that was not involved at all. Thus it is best to just discard the message.

# This file is addressing the headers of a message. Use it for the postfix mailer, eg. by 
# placing it in a file /etc/postfix/header_checks and add the following line to /etc/postfix/main.cf :
# header_checks = regexp:/etc/postfix/header_checks
# (without the leading #-comment character) ; then restart postfix with: service postfix restart

# UPDATES AND CORRECTIONS WELCOME!

# Use at your own risk. The lines below may silently delete valid e-mails.
